# AAI500 - Symptom-Based Disease Classification
Project Details:
This project is part of the final term submission for the M.S. in Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) course AAI500. It focuses on building machine learning models for symptom-based disease classification using various approaches including LSTM, GRU, BERT, and TF-IDF.
